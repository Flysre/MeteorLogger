2) Drag all files on a Virtual Private Server, in the HTML folder.<br>
Note : You need PHP 7 > in order to run the API scripts correctly.

3) Enter the server destination where you've installed the API Files (example : https://1.2.3.4/RAT/).<br>
   Then, make sure every needed API file is in there.<br>![](https://i.imgur.com/Tn2RWgs.png)<br>
   
4) Launch MeteorLogger.exe and write the full server URL which gives an access to the API files.
If you're encountering errors related to r/w permissions, you may have reconfigure file access permissions, as shown [here](https://i.imgur.com/G30DGRW.gifv).

5) You now have succesfully configured MeteorLogger.<br>
